# Kitty-Game-in-python
Kitty is a card game that is played widely in Nepal


This program (kitty.py) shows the best possible arrangement of 9 cards grouped into three according to the rules of Kitty game.

Anyone interested to build the complete game with bots(Computer AI) as alternate players can use this program to assign the best 
possible combination of cards to the bots(Computer AI).
The program can be used to find the best possible combination of cards that are a multiple of 3 according to the rules of Kitty. 
The multiple should be less than 52 (because there are only 52 cards in a deck).
